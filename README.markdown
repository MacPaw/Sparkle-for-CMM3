# Sparkle for CMM 3

## Reason to fork

Knowledgebase behaves like a bundle, but it's not a bundle. Due to optimizations original Sparkl doesn't work well with our fake bundle

## How it's integrated

DevMate has an option(`USED_CUSTOM_SPARKLE_FRAMEWORK`) to provide a custom Sparkl instead of a built-in one
